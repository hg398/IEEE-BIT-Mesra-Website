                        IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Student's Chapter BIT Mesra believes in a constant
                        endeavour to inculcate among students the requisite knowledge to catch up with their peers across the
                        global community and most importantly, tomorrow. The club ensures this through quality workshops on
                        contemporary topics, and through events which are aimed at sharpening cognition among participants and
                        organizers alike. At IEEE, we believe in disseminating what we know and learning what we don't.
